## How to play :dice:

This game has two players, and goes by round. On your turn, you can roll the two dice as many times as you wish to add to your round score. 

Clicking hold will add the points earned to your total score. However, if you a roll a 1 on either dice, you lose your points for the round and it is the next players turn. If you roll double sixes, you will lose your entire score. 

The score to play to can be set within the input up top. The default score is playing to 100.
